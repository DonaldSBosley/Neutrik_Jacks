=============
Neutrik Jack Set V 0.0:
2014 Don Bosley
for corrections / updates email : don@bosleymusic.com
DESCRIPTION: 3d models, stereo-lithography files, etc... along with schematic and PCB footprints for KiCad for various Neutrik PCB mounted 1/4" Jacks. 

WORKFLOW: 
- Build OpenSCAD models from datasheets. 
- Export .stl, "clean-up" .stl using "meshconv" (LINK HERE)
- Import .stl to WINGs3D, colorize, export to .vrml
- Create footprints in KiCad
- Verified Pin Alignment

Covers Neutrik 1/4" Jacks : 
M-SERIES:

NMJ6HFD2-AU, NMJ6HFD3, NMJ6HHD2

SLIM SERIES: 
NRJ3HF-1, NRJ4HF, NRJ4HF-1, NRJ4HH, NRJ4HH-1, NRJ6HF, NRJ6HF-AU, NRJ6HF-1, NRJ6HF-1-AU, NRJ6HH , NRJ6HH-AU, NRJ6HH-1, NRJ6HM-1, NRJ6HM-1-AU, NRJ6HM-1-PRE


Known Issues :
- Need to update front screw heights / washers / threads
- Offset pin heights need to be elevated
- Footprints for slim jacks do not include "plastic nubs" although 3D Models do
- All footprints have been created in KiCad to match 3D Models for the respective jacks, need to figure out how to contribute to that repository
